      "expected_answer": "10",
      "generated_text": "Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?\n\nAnswer: Let's solve this step by step.\nFirst, we need to convert the 50 minutes into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can divide 50 by 60 to get 50/60 = 1/1.33.\nNext, we need to determine how many hours it would take to complete the 50 minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, we can divide 50 by 60 to get 50/60 = 0.83 hours.\nNow, we can calculate how much Weng earned by multiplying the number of hours it would take to complete the 50 minutes by her hourly rate. Since Weng earns $12 an hour, we can calculate 0.83 x 12 = $9.96.\nTherefore, Weng earned $9.96 for the 50 minutes of babysitting. The answer is 9.96.",

How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?\n\nAnswer: Let's solve this step by step.\nBetty needs $100 for the wallet. She has only half of it, which is $100 / 2 = $50.\nHer parents give her $15, bringing her to $50 + $15 = $65.\nHer grandparents give her twice as much, which is $100 x 2 = $200.\nAdding all of this together, Betty now has $65 + $200 = $265.\nBetty needs $265 - $100 = $165 more.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 165.",

So, the total number of pages he writes in a week is 3 * 2 = 6 pages.\n5. Now, we need to find out how many pages he writes in a year. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we need to multiply the number of pages he writes in a week by 52.\n6. The total number of pages he writes in a year is 6 * 52 = 312 pages.\n\nFinal answer: James writes 312 pages in a year.",

There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?\n\nAnswer: Let's solve this step by step.\nLet the number of green flowers be x. Since there are 80% more of the purple flowers in Mark's garden, there are 80/100 * 10 = 8 more purple flowers. In total, there are 10 + 8 = 18 flowers of each color. In Mark's garden, there are 18 green flowers. Since there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers, 25/100 * 18 = 4.5 less green flowers. Since we can't have a fraction of a flower, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. In Mark's garden, there are 18 - 4.5 = 13.5 green flowers. The total number of flowers in Mark's garden is 10 yellow, 18 yellow and purple, and 13.5 green, or 32.5. Since you can't have a fraction of a flower, you need to round up to the nearest whole number. There are 33 flowers in Mark's garden. The answer is 33.",

Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans. And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again. What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?\n\nAnswer: Let's solve this step by step.\nFirst, we find that after adding enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds, the box has a weight of 2 pounds. Then we add enough brownies to cause the weight to triple. This means that after adding the brownies, the box has a weight of 2 * 3 = 6 pounds. Next, we add another 2 pounds of jelly beans. So after adding the jelly beans, the box has a weight of 6 + 2 = 8 pounds. Finally, we add enough gummy worms to double the weight. This means that after adding the gummy worms, the box has a weight of 8 * 2 = 16 pounds.\nThe answer is 16.",

How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?\n\nAnswer: Let's solve this step by step.\nFirst, we find the total amount Alexis spent on the other clothes by adding the cost of each: $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $133. The total amount Alexis spent on the clothes was $133 - $16 = $117. That means the shoes cost $117 - $30 = $87. The answer is 87.\nFinal answer: 87.",
